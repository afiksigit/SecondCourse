# SecondCourse
This is the second course in Python. This course is the advanced course.
It includes six different topics:
1. One liners
2. OOP
3. Exceptions
4. Generators
5. Iterators
6. Modules

The files in the repository describe my answers to questions throughout the course. In the files called chapterx (x indicates a course number), there are the coded answers to the regular exercises in the course. On the other hand, the files called chapterX-SummaryEx contain the summary exercises of each chapter.
Files with other names are used in some exercises.

Notes:
* In the file chapter1 there is also the concluding exercise of the first chapter.
* The files named: "file1.py", "file2" and "main.py" belong to a certain exercise in chapter 6.
